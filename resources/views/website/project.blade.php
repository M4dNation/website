					<strong>Yggdrasill</strong> is a crowdsourcing platform for video games players and developers in order to help them create games closer to their needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Yggdrasill</strong> is built on the top of a new tree representation model in order to allow everyone to take part, share and discuss his point about every game element. It also incorporates a lot of features for communication and crowdsourcing such as media vizualisation, chat channels and more.

				<p>
					Follow the production of your favorite games <strong>from the first idea to their official release </strong>with a blog and  a roadmap specifics to each game and stay in touch with the developers thanks to social network integration.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even better, <strong>post your own games</strong> and watch them grow in a skilled and passionate community in order to have them developed by <strong>the greatest video games studios</strong> in the world.
