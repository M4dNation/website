				<h1>Why ?</h1>
				<p>We started with a very simple idea: <b>Which player has not dreamed of creating their own video game?</b></p>
				<p>And the answer is equally simple: <b>None.</b></p>
				<p>But creating a game is complicated. <b>You must have skills in programming, graphic design, music, writing, and put it all together.</b> Then you have to promote it, talk around you and get feedback from other players.</b></p>
				<p>It's a lot of problems, you don't want to deal with : <b>you want a game that you like, a game that surprises you, a game that challenges you!</b></p>
				<p>Ideally, you would need some sort of <b>jar</b>, where everyone throw his <b>ideas</b>, react and share others'. And the best would be the <b>tree</b> growing by itself inside it.</p>
				<p>The best <b>ideas</b> will help the <b>tree</b> grow while the others will fall to make room for news ones to come.</p>
				<p>And when the <b>jar</b> becomes too small, we give this small <b>tree</b> to professionals, who will help it grow exactly as you wish, <b>amid a forest of other small trees from around the world.</b> </p>
				<p>	Well, you can stop looking, <b>this is exactly what Yggdrasil is.</b></p>
