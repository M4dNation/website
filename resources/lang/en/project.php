    'yggdrasill1' => '<b>Welcome</b> to the extensive description of our project.',
    'yggdrasill2' => '<b>Yggdrasill is a crowdsourcing platform for players and video game studios.</b>',
    'yggdrasill3' => 'The goal is to allow you to describe <b>your games</b> as you dream them, and give them life with many talented <b>professionals studios</b> spread around the world.',
    'whyTitle' => 'Why ?',
    'why1' => 'We started with a very simple idea: <b>Which player has not dreamed of creating their own video game?</b>',
    'why2' => 'And the answer is equally simple: <b>None.</b>',
    'why3' => 'But creating a game is complicated. <b>You must have skills in programming, graphic design, music, writing, and put it all together.</b> Then you have to promote it, spread the word and get feedback from other players.</b>',
    'why4' => 'It\'s a lot of problems, you don\'t want to deal with : <b>you want a game that you like, a game that surprises you, a game that challenges you!</b>',
    'why5' => 'Ideally, you would need some sort of <b>jar</b>, where everyone throw his <b>ideas</b>, react and share others\'. And the best would be the <b>tree</b> growing by itself inside it.',
    'why6' => 'The best <b>ideas</b> will help the <b>tree</b> grow while the others will fall to make room for new ones to come.',
    'why7' => 'And when the <b>jar</b> becomes too small, we give this small <b>tree</b> to professionals, who will help it grow exactly as you wish, <b>amid a forest of other small trees from around the world.</b>',
    'why8' => 'Well, you can stop looking, <b>this is exactly what Yggdrasil is.</b>',
    'howTitle' => 'How it works ?',
    'how1' => 'The principle is simple: you put a <b>game idea</b> on the platform, and all other users can react in order to <b>modify or improve it.</b>',
    'how2' => 'Each <b>game idea</b> presented on the platform is thus considered as a <b>project</b>.',
    'how3' => 'All projects on Yggdrasill work in three phases: <b>design, production and diffusion.</b>',
    'how4' => 'During <b>the design phase</b>, users help creating <b>a tree</b> by discussing the <b>game idea</b>, modifying or improving it. The <b>tree</b> is a graphical representation of a <b>game project</b>, and contains all the ideas submitted.',
    'how5' => 'When a <b>tree</b> reaches maturity, it is frozen, giving <b>the final representation</b> of the game project in the form of a <b>detailed specification</b> ready to be produced.',
    'how6' => 'If the original idea came from <b>an indie studio</b>, it may decide to start <b>the production phase</b> and begin development.',
    'how7' => 'If it came from <b>a player</b>, we will find a studio willing to carry out <b>the production phase </b>of the game in accordance with <b>your expectations.</b>',
    'how8' => 'When <b>the first release</b> is available, the project is finally in <b>the diffusion phase</b>, in which you can start <b>promoting the game you help created</b> around you and gather more players until <b>the final release.</b>',
    'whatTitle' => 'What\'s next ?',
    'what1' => 'We are working on a <b>prototype</b> to show you <b>Yggdrasill</b>.',
    'what2' => 'Further informations will be described on this page such as features and a description of the model property tree.',
